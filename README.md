Description
===========
This site allows the user to select a trip to the MLB stadiums of their choice around the country in a bucket list trip of them.   It will provide an itinerary compiler, a route map, and a checked off list for the user. This route persists beyond page refreshes and an individual user can track stadiums visited on a final page where comments, images, and game dates are collected and stored.
